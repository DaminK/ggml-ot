# ggml-ot - Improve Optimal Transport applications by Global Ground Metric Learning on Distribution Classes

The Python package for "Global Ground Metric Learning with Applications to scRNA data" published at AISTATS2025. Learning a Global Metric as the Ground Metric of a Optimal Transport (OT) distance improves downstream-applications, such as classification, clustering and embeddings on synthetic and realworld scRNA-seq data. By learning a low-rank Mahalanobis distance between elements of distributions, GGML-OT learns interpretable low-dimensional subspaces that capture the class relations between distributions under OT. For scRNA-seq data containing patients at different disease stages, this corresponds to subspaces of the gene expression space realted to disease-related biological processes.

## Installation
To get started, install ggml-ot via pip:
```bash
pip install ggml-ot
```
